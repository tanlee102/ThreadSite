ThreadSite is a dynamic website that combines the functionalities of a forum and a social media platform. It provides a space where users can actively participate in discussions, share their thoughts, and upload posts on a wide range of topics. Whether you're looking to connect with like-minded individuals, seek advice, or engage in meaningful conversations, ThreadSite offers a user-friendly interface and intuitive design to enhance your browsing experience. 

The ThreadSite website incorporates the following technologies:

- HTML and CSS are used for creating the structure and styling of the website.
- Backend and Frontend: JavaScript is utilized for both the backend and frontend development, with Next.js and Express.js frameworks providing the foundation.
- Databases: ThreadSite employs MySQL and MongoDB databases for data storage and retrieval. MySQL is a reliable relational database management system, while MongoDB is a flexible and scalable NoSQL database solution.
- Image Server: The website utilizes two different technologies for the image server. PHP is employed for image processing and management, while Python's FastAPI framework offers a high-performance solution for serving images efficiently.
- Proxy: Nginx is utilized as a proxy server to handle incoming requests, route traffic, and provide additional security and performance optimizations.
